# Streamlit Learning Project

This repository contains my personal learning journey with **Streamlit**. I have documented everything I practiced, including:

- Basic Streamlit commands
- Layouts and components
- Forms and input handling
- Session state usage
- Charts and visualizations (matplotlib, pandas, numpy)

The goal of this repo is to maintain simple examples that help me quickly revise and experiment while learning Streamlit.

## 🚀 How to Set Up the Project Locally

Follow these steps to run the Streamlit application on your machine.

### **1. Navigate to the project directory**
```powershell
cd C:\Git-Projects\stramlit-project
```

---

### **2. Create a Python 3.11 virtual environment**
(You must have Python **3.11.x** installed.)

Try:
```powershell
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
```

If that doesn't work, use:
```powershell
python3.11 -m venv .venv
```

---

### **3. Activate the virtual environment**
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Your terminal prompt should now show:
```
(.venv)
```

---

### **4. Upgrade essential tools**
```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

---

### **5. Install Streamlit and dependencies**
```powershell
pip install streamlit
pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib
```

---

### **6. Run the Streamlit App**
Make sure your main file is named `main.py` (or adjust accordingly):
```powershell
streamlit run main.py
```

## ⭐ Notes
- This project is a learning sandbox — code may be simple, experimental, or intentionally basic.
- Python 3.14 is **not supported** by Streamlit yet. Always use Python **3.11** for this repo.
- Contributions (even personal ones) are welcome as the learning continues!
